# Elucidate AI Technical Assessment

This project contains the code for my Elucidate AI technical asseessment.

## Overview

The two main files are model.py and analysis.ipynb. The code is documented but since this was more of a play enviroment using it in production is not advised. Many times I ran things once to see what happened and commented it out. I made use of pandas, numpy, scikit-learn and matplotlib for various parts of this assessment.

## model.py

This contains the logisitc regression model that was trained.

## analysis.ipynb

This is a jupyter notebook which I used to visualize and look at data. Note some blocks don't work with certain encodings and I changed them as I went.
